 - combined LAYOUt and CONTENT for all (I don't see a reason top keep seperate)
 - combined HEADER and NAV (seemed to go together)
 - modularized into
	- HEADER and NAV
	- BODY
	- FOOTER
- built each module based on size (sm, md, lg, xl)
	- where sm is the deafult - mobile first






problem: 900-1400 the icons in the col-3 are too big !!!
